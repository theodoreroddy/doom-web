## ‚ú® Features

- **Full WAD Parser**: Reads IWAD and PWAD files
- **Map Loading**: Parses all map data (THINGS, LINEDEFS, SIDEDEFS, SECTORS, VERTEXES, etc.)
- **3D Rendering**: Real-time 3D rendering using Three.js
- **First-Person Controls**: WASD movement and mouse look
- **Collision Detection**: Wall collision with sliding
- **Multiple Maps**: Support for both Doom 1 (E#M#) and Doom 2 (MAP##) formats
- **Lighting System**: Dynamic lighting based on sector data
- **Texture Mapping**: Color-coded walls based on Doom texture names

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- A Doom WAD file (see "Getting WAD Files" section)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **(Optional but recommended)** Copy your WAD file to the `public/` directory:
```bash
cp /path/to/your/doom1.wad public/doom1.wad
```
The app will automatically load it on startup!

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser to the URL shown (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Load a WAD File**
   - Click "Load WAD File" button
   - Select your Doom WAD file (DOOM.WAD, DOOM2.WAD, etc.)
   - The game will automatically parse the file and show available maps

2. **Select a Map**
   - Choose a map from the dropdown menu
   - Maps will be named E#M# (Doom 1) or MAP## (Doom 2)

3. **Start the Game**
   - Click "Start Game"
   - Click on the game canvas to lock the pointer and begin playing

### Controls

- **W/A/S/D** - Move forward/left/backward/right
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **Shift** - Sprint
- **ESC** - Release pointer lock

## üìÅ Getting WAD Files

You'll need a Doom WAD file to use this application. There are several options:

### Option 1: Commercial WAD Files
If you own Doom, you can use the WAD files from your installation:
- **DOOM.WAD** - Doom 1 (shareware version may work with limited levels)
- **DOOM2.WAD** - Doom 2
- **PLUTONIA.WAD** - Final Doom - The Plutonia Experiment
- **TNT.WAD** - Final Doom - TNT: Evilution

These can be purchased from:
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/Ultimate_Doom/)
- [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/the_ultimate_doom)

### Option 2: Shareware WAD
The Doom 1 shareware WAD (DOOM1.WAD) is freely available and legal to download:
- [Doom Shareware on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/DoomsharewareEpisode)

### Option 3: FreeDoom
FreeDoom is a completely free and open-source WAD file:
- [FreeDoom.org](https://freedoom.github.io/)
- Download `freedoom1.wad` or `freedoom2.wad`

## üîß Technical Details

### WAD File Format

The project includes a complete WAD parser that understands:
- **Header**: IWAD/PWAD identification
- **Directory**: Lump table with offsets
- **Lumps**: Individual data chunks (maps, textures, sounds, etc.)

### Map Data Structures

Each map contains:
- **THINGS**: Object placement (monsters, items, player starts)
- **LINEDEFS**: Wall definitions
- **SIDEDEFS**: Wall texture references
- **VERTEXES**: Map vertices
- **SECTORS**: Floor/ceiling definitions
- **SEGS**: BSP segments
- **SSECTORS**: Sub-sectors
- **NODES**: BSP tree nodes

### Rendering Pipeline

1. Parse WAD file structure
2. Extract map data for selected level
3. Build 3D geometry from 2D map data
4. Create Three.js meshes with materials
5. Set up camera at player start position
6. Render scene with collision detection

### Coordinate System

Doom uses a 2D coordinate system that we convert to 3D:
- Doom X ‚Üí Three.js X
- Doom Y ‚Üí Three.js -Z (flipped)
- Height ‚Üí Three.js Y

## üé® Customization

### Adding Real Textures

Currently, the game uses color-coded walls. To add real texture support:

1. Extract textures from WAD files using the PNAMES and TEXTURE1/TEXTURE2 lumps
2. Convert to canvas/image format using the PLAYPAL color palette
3. Create THREE.Texture objects and apply to materials

### Performance Tuning

Adjust these values in `game.js`:
```javascript
// Camera far plane (render distance)
camera.far = 10000;

// Fog distance
scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(0x000000, 1000, 5000);

// Movement speed
player.speed = 200;
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

- Textures are rendered as solid colors (texture extraction not yet implemented)
- Sky rendering not implemented
- No monsters or AI
- No weapons or shooting
- No doors/lifts (static map only)
- Simplified lighting model

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Full texture extraction and rendering
- [ ] Animated textures
- [ ] Door and lift mechanisms
- [ ] Monster rendering (decorative)
- [ ] Audio support (music and sound effects)
- [ ] Save/load position
- [ ] Multiple WAD support
- [ ] WebGL2 optimizations
