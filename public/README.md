i th# WAD File Directory

Place your DOOM WAD file here for automatic loading.

## Supported filenames:
- `doom1.wad` (recommended)
- `doom.wad`

## How to add your WAD:

1. Copy your DOOM WAD file to this directory
2. Rename it to one of the supported filenames above (e.g., `doom1.wad`)
3. Refresh the web application - it will automatically load!

## Note:
- The WAD file will be automatically detected and loaded when you start the app

- Make sure your WAD file is from DOOM 1 or DOOM 2 (shareware or registered version)
